The platform includes three dashboards, which presumably serve different purposes such as application submission, review, and administration. These dashboards help in managing the entire lifecycle of grant applications from submission to final selection. It focuses on applications from Lagos state residents, indicating a regional or localized scope for the grants. Initially, the portal was used to process applications for a grant amounting to â‚¦255 million. This grant was intended to fund 51 projects within Lagos state. This indicates a significant financial impact aimed at supporting various community-driven projects aligned with SDGs."
